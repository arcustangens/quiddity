# Adobe Garamond Pro Fonts

To complete the setup, you need to:

1. Purchase and download Adobe Garamond Pro fonts from Adobe or another licensed provider
2. Convert them to web formats (woff2 and woff) using a tool like https://transfonter.org/
3. Place the following files in this directory:
   - AGaramondPro-Regular.woff2
   - AGaramondPro-Regular.woff
   - AGaramondPro-Italic.woff2
   - AGaramondPro-Italic.woff

Until then, the site will fall back to EB Garamond, which is a high-quality free alternative.
