jump, jump, jump - ever so gently
never try, never cry, always giving, always taking
can you ever see the tangent cruel creatures have been striking?
press them to it - let me do it
crazy hoop and we've been through it
lament to the senile moons expecting things to happen but they remain reluctant
why would you do that - it's not like there's places to go and try your luck there's only currents and rocks and ducks and trees
identity is illusory yet they allow us in cinemas somehow (i'm not 13 yet)
