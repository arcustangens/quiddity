Fear engulfes and leads astray  
in these god forsaken halls  
slowly creeps in while you play  
among firebreathing walls

Don't mistake it for the cold  
even though its thrill will chill  
It is neither young or old  
it can laugh and it can kill

You will always pay the cost  
It will never hear your plea  
Know that you've already lost  
when the choice is: fight or flee
