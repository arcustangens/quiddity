Crimson leaves dance on the wind,  
Memories of summer slowly rescind.  
Golden light through branches bare,  
Nature's farewell beyond compare.

Crisp morning frost adorns the ground,  
While migrant birds southward bound  
Paint the sky in farewell streams,  
Like fragments of forgotten dreams.

In this moment between seasons grand,  
Time pauses, as if by command.  
Autumn whispers ancient lore,  
Of cycles ending, and what's in store.
