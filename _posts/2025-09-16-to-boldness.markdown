Oh, whisper me ye!  
so brimming with glee  
heart laden with youthful desire!  
A tale of the Bold,  
a tale oh so old  
'tis heard around many a fire  
Speak not of the faint -  
however they quaint! -  
I'm sickened by prudent compliance  
'til I sail yonder  
please, let me ponder  
these fearless, magnificent Giants!
