Life got me lemons  
said I wanted lime  
Sold out all my demons  
barely made a dime  
Not enough to buy me time or cough up the fine  
If god wasn't real though I'd be down to clown  
but his silence makes it feel like he's a fucking mime  
shit, I've crossed the line  
but it crossed my mind  
I ain't the kind to find the right type of fight  
so I just died  
for a while though, hoped to see you smile a little  
see a bit of light in the brittle blight of the cripple man up in the sky  
it's done, it was kinda fly  
tryna find a buncha fun in the run through these plains  
full of grains ripe with pain and love alike  
syke, it ain't  
just play along friends, it's all that remains
