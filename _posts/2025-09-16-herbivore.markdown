Crazy how you do it, right?  
Straight on target, laser sight  
Mine is like a herbivore  
Nothing strikes me to my core  
Even though you wanna fight  
I will use up all my might  
to do my best to ignore you  
can even bow before you  
just to show you  
how much you fuckin' bore me

Lions and fawns, we're all the same  
Vivid fauna in a board game  
Y'all are pawns, tryna act like kings  
Boy it stings  
But lose the hate, and make amends  
'cause you and your animal friends  
Are due for a checkmate  
So don't try to change your fate  
It's way too late
