I knew a man who turned to stone
with power to turn back
I asked him how the process went
he said it's mostly black
but then you wake up and you feel
a sudden urge to roll
so you give in and you don't stop
until you're in a hole
I asked him what would happen next,
if there is a way out
He glanced at me then laughed out loud
and calmly looked about
"Of course, you can turn back to man,
rocks just don't think that way"
He grinned towards my puzzled face
and slowly rolled away
