At first glance I thought the hail  
turned my day into a dark night  
peaceful trance into a fierce fight  
made me pray to no avail

Closer look revealed the truth  
that's been hidden from my sight  
Truth that took away my fright  
Truth forbidden since my youth

You can drown in heavy rain  
burn in fire, freeze in snow  
Not to frown you have to know  
That, which inspires, is pain
