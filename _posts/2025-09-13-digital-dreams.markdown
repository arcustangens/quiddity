In circuits deep and silicon dreams,  
Nothing is quite what it seems.  
Binary whispers in the night,  
Code dancing in pale screen light.

Through fiber optic veins we flow,  
To places only data knows.  
Virtual worlds in pixeled grace,  
Time and distance we embrace.

Are we the ghosts in these machines,  
Or are they echoes of our dreams?  
In this digital reverie,  
What does it mean to truly be?
