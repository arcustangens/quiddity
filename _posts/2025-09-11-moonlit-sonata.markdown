Silver light on midnight snow,  
Stars above and earth below.  
Silent world in winter's keep,  
While mortals dream in slumber deep.

Luna's dance across the sky,  
Owl's wisdom in night's reply.  
Frost patterns on window pane,  
Nature's art in crystal frame.

In this pause between the days,  
When shadow with the starlight plays,  
Magic in the darkness dwells,  
Stories that the night wind tells.
