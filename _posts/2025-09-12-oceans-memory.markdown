Waves remember ancient shores,  
Tales of times that came before.  
In depths of blue and foamy white,  
Secrets kept in endless night.

Coral cities slowly grow,  
While tides eternal come and go.  
In this vast and rolling sea,  
Earth's first dreams of what could be.

We stand upon these changing sands,  
Time slipping through our mortal hands.  
While oceans rise and oceans fall,  
Nature's rhythm moves us all.
