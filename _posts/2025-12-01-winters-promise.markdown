In December's gentle hush,
When snowflakes softly fall,
Nature dons her silver crown,
And frost adorns the wall.

Each crystal forms a story,
Each icicle a dream,
Of spring that lies in waiting
Beneath the frozen stream.

*Though winter claims the landscape now,
With touches sharp and clear,
Within the earth life slumbers still,
Till spring shall reappear.*
