Steel and glass reach for the sky,  
While subway rumbles deep reply.  
City pulse in morning light,  
A million stories taking flight.

Coffee steam and hurried feet,  
Street musician's rhythm beat.  
Taxi horns in discord sing,  
Urban bells in churches ring.

This concrete jungle's living soul,  
Each part playing its own role.  
In this grand metropolis show,  
Life's tempo - fast and slow.
