Will you try to face the man  
who's been crying since your birth  
hardly stopping for a breath?  
Constant sadness is his plan,  
his salvation is your death

Even though there is a chance  
he is just a plain old fool  
Try, my lord, to play it cool  
Don't allow him to make sense  
of the kingdom which you rule

Since he doesn't know defeat  
doesn't back down from a fight  
If you want to make things right  
you will simply have no need  
even for your strongest knight

We need a jester, so ring the bells  
to force the sadness out of my cells!  
No need, my highness, which I so admire  
For there's no bigger jester than you, sire
