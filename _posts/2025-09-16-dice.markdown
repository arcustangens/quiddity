Cutting edge sociology  
lots of love for a eulogy  
all sorts of brown and grey  
and people drown  
when they play with it  
I dig it  
and I mean it  
but god forbid if you leave it to chance  
whether you die or slow dance  
lie down and try not to cry  
or prance to the trance beat that's been on repeat  
since what feels like forever  
whatever  
it's nice  
that I can roll the dice  
whenever
